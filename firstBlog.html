    <h1>Cheese burger ingredients</h1>

    <p class="firstLine">What ingredients to use for a good burger</p>
    <p class="bodyPara">One should use simple ingredients, kosher salt and ground black pepper. That's it.  If you're using anything else, you're doing it wrong.  Alos, the type of beef is important.  One must use ground chuck, aka beef shoulder where the meat is 80% and the fat is 20%.  The fat both tastes good and lets the burgers stick together so it doesn't fall apart.</p>
    <p class="bodyPara">The patties are usually about a quarter pound, so one pound will make 4 burgers.  Make your patties, sprinkle a generous amount of kosher salt and black pepper on both sides.  Grill away.  Don't over cook the meat.  The top side should give off a bit of blood and as soon as the top is brown, flip.  Give it a few minutes and you'll have a nice, medium rare burger.  Enjoy</p>
